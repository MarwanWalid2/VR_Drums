This project in hand is based on the VR definition of “creating illusions of another place,
another body”. The project takes place in an abandoned house in the middle of nowhere
as an act of escapism. A pinkish light was used to give a sense of sunset time to give a
more chilling vibe for the user.

At the beginning of the project, the user spawns outside the house and hears the music,
and goes inside the house to find someone playing the drums as they get louder the
closer it gets. After the unknown guy stops playing, the user finds two sticks in his
hands that can use to play the drums while the unknown person looks and claps for
him. When the user hits the drums it creates different sounds, volumes, and pitches
depending on how hard the user actually hits it (as if it was real drums). What I was
trying to achieve is to make the user embody different perspectives of the same
scenario at the same time. He is once the spectator and once the drummer.
